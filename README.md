# [The Hitchhiker's AI Guide To Drug Discovery](https://www.hitchhikersai.org/)

## Our Mission


To enable small to mid-size wet-lab focused biotechs with data science opportunities, skills and environments, so they can do early drug discovery faster and more cost-efficiently.  Through a community of biologists, data scientists, statisticians from biotechs, vendors, and academia.​

The goal of this community project is to demystify the opportunities for AI in early drug discovery in vitro experiments, and to give scientists the clarity and confidence to take shot!  This will be done through a Galaxy AI Map diagram, education, and community building.

## This repo

This repo will be eternally a work in progress. We want to create simple and accessible content first, and incrementally up the ante until we are on the cutting edge. We want to demystify the jargon, simplify the process and create a series of tools that anyone can use. We will start with a series of notebooks as a prepartion for the release of our package. 

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone git@github.com:Hitchhikers-AI-Guide/AIGuideToDrugDiscovery.git
```
2. Step into the folder and create your python virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate and install requirements
```
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

If it's your first encoutner with python and notebooks - use VSCode. Navigate to the notebooks folder. All the sample data you need is in the data folder, and we'll provide links or instructions on how to get larger datasets.
