For now, we don't have any single SMIRNOFF force field that can handle both proteins and small molecules; the Rosemary 3.0.0 force field will support this, but it's not expected until 2023. As an alternative, we'll combine the Sage small molecule force field with the SMIRNOFF port of Amber ff14SB.

Rather than using atom types like traditional biomolecular force fields, Sage assigns parameters to a molecule by [matching actual chemical moieties]. Note that to parametrize a molecule you need more than just the co-ordinates of its atoms; you also need their bonds, bond orders, and formal charges. As a result, `.sdf` files are used in this example; other file types are possible, but they must include this information. Sage is distributed as an `.offxml` file according to the [SMIRNOFF specification]. This file describes all the choices the toolkit has to make to parametrize a molecule. Sage also includes the TIP3P water model, which is appropriate for Amber ff14SB too.\n",

Since the Toolkit always applies the last parameters that match a moiety, this order makes sure the right parameters get assigned.\n",

        "\n",
        "A primary goal of the Open Force Field Initiative is to make development and use of force fields as open as possible - it's in our name! We believe that open source development practices have a lot to offer the scientific community, whether that science is academic, commercial, or hobbyist.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The SMIRNOFF specification\n",
        "\n",
        "The SMIRNOFF specification describes a simple format for describing molecular force fields. We provide and maintain this spec in the hopes that it will allow scientists everywhere to contribute to force field development in a unified way, without taking them away from their favourite simulation package.\n",
        "\n",
        "SMIRNOFF is not just a spec; we're also committed to a reference implementation — that being the OpenFF Toolkit. The Toolkit endeavors to support all the functional forms in both the SMIRNOFF spec and the [`openff-forcefields`](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-forcefields/) package.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenFF force fields are completely specified by the name of the distributed `.offxml` file. We use codenames, version numbers, and tags to accomplish this. This means that as long as a user, designer, or reviewer sees the name of the force field being used, they know exactly what is going in to that simulation. We include parameters that are often neglected in force field specifications, such as the non-bonded cut-off distance, ewald methods, constraints, modifications to the Lennard-Jones function, and partial charge generation methods are all defined by the name of the force field.\n",
        "\n",
        "As much as possible, we want energy and force to be a deterministic output of combining a molecule and a force field. If an author provides the name of the force field in their methods section, it should be reproducible. The other side of this coin is that we never want to hide the force field from the user. In all our workflows, the name of the force field must be explicitly provided in the code. This improves reproducibility of the code and helps the user take responsibility for their results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### \"Plugin\" support for new force fields\n",
        "\n",
        "The OpenFF Toolkit supports distributing force field files (.offxml) through Conda data packages. Anyone can publish a package on Conda Forge that extends the list of directories the toolkit searches for force fields, allowing anyone to produce force fields without requiring their own tooling, in a format that is designed to be converted to a multitude of simulation packages. See the [FAQ](https://open-forcefield-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#how-can-i-distribute-my-own-force-fields-in-smirnoff-format) for more details.\n",

        "* The OpenFF workflow cleanly separates the chemical system from its model.\n",
        "* We parametrize ligands and proteins with the same software tools.\n",
        "* Open source tools installed via Conda did everything, from basic system prep to simulation and visualization\n",
        "* Using OpenMM, we never had to leave Python to set up the simulation\n",
        "* With Interchange, using OpenMM, GROMACS, Amber or LAMMPS is simple!\n",
